--sol 1 with lead window function as 2 values compared. But this is not best solution
with cte as ( 
    select 
    *
    ,lag(product_id) over (partition by customer_id,dates order by customer_id) as concat-- partition done based on customer id and daywise
from 
    orders
    )
SELECT
    concat(product_id,',',concat) as products
    ,dates
from
    cte
WHERE
    concat is not NULL
UNION
   SELECT
    product_id :: text --as column product_id should be same data type
    ,dates
from
    orders
order by 
    dates

--sol 2- using string_agg function

SELECT
    dates
    ,cast(product_id as text) as products
from
    orders
UNION
select
    dates
    ,string_agg(cast(product_id as text),',') as products
from
    orders
GROUP by
    dates, customer_id
order by
    dates, products
