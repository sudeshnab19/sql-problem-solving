--Approach 1- using arithmetic function to compare rows and generate the job_role
-- used sub-query to generate the row_id with value
select
    *
    ,case when row_id< (select row_id from job_skills WHERE job_role='Web Developer') then 'Data Engineer'
    when row_id< (select row_id from job_skills WHERE job_role='Data Scientist') then 'Web Developer'
    else 'Data Scientist'
    end as new 
from
    job_skills

--Approach 2- using sum window function which seregates each department as per job_role
-- used first_value window function to get the first value of each segment

with cte as (

select
    *
    ,sum(case when job_role is null then 0 else 1 end) over (order by row_id    ) as segment
from
    job_skills
)
SELECT
    row_id
    ,first_value(job_role) over(PARTITION by cte.segment order by row_id) as job_role_updated
    ,skills
from
    cte
